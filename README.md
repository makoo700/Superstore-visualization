# Introduction

I worked with the Sample Superstore dataset (9,994 transactions, 2014–2017).
I was focused on transforming raw retail data into executive-ready visual dashboards using Python.The overarching goal was to diagnose profitability drivers, regional trends, discounting behaviors, and customer patterns.

# Questions I Wanted to Answer

- Which product categories are profitable, and which lose money?

- How do sales trends vary across regions over time?

- Does discounting improve or harm profitability?

- What does the distribution of sales look like—are there typical order values?

- Which region–category combinations drive the most profit or loss?

- What single insight would help a CEO improve profitability tomorrow?

# Analysis

Bar Chart: Compared profit margins across categories to identify winners and losers.

Line Chart: Tracked regional sales trends, highlighting seasonal spikes (e.g., holiday peaks).

Scatter Plot: Explored the relationship between discounts and profits, showing how heavy discounting often leads to losses.

Histogram + KDE: Analyzed sales distribution, revealing skewness and the “long tail” of high-value orders.

Heatmap: Mapped profitability by region and category, pinpointing the strongest and weakest combinations.

Executive Summary: Synthesized findings into concise recommendations for leadership.

# Conclusion

I developed the ability to diagnose business performance using Python visualizations.

Ipracticed turning complex datasets into clear, executive-level insights.

Ultimately, I learned how to bridge technical analysis with strategic decision-making—a core skill for any data analyst.
